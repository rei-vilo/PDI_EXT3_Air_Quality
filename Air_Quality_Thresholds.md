# Air Quality Thresholds

Answered by https://chatgpt.com/, 30 Jan 2024

## What are the thresholds for good, moderate, poor, bad, unhealthy and hazardous for particulate matters of 1.0, 2.5, 4.0 and 10.0 in µg per cubic meter?

The thresholds for particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³), vary depending on the specific size of the particles (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4.0, and PM10.0). These thresholds are often based on air quality standards set by organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Here’s a general guideline for the various categories of air quality for different particulate matter sizes:

### **PM1.0 (Fine Particulate Matter ≤ 1.0 µm)**

| **AQI Category**     | **µg/m³**         |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Good**             | 0 - 35 µg/m³      |
| **Moderate**         | 36 - 75 µg/m³     |
| **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | 76 - 150 µg/m³  |
| **Unhealthy**        | 151 - 250 µg/m³   |
| **Very Unhealthy**   | 251 - 350 µg/m³   |
| **Hazardous**        | > 350 µg/m³       |

### **PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter ≤ 2.5 µm)**

| **AQI Category**     | **µg/m³**         |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Good**             | 0 - 12 µg/m³      |
| **Moderate**         | 13 - 35 µg/m³     |
| **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | 36 - 55 µg/m³  |
| **Unhealthy**        | 56 - 150 µg/m³    |
| **Very Unhealthy**   | 151 - 250 µg/m³   |
| **Hazardous**        | > 250 µg/m³       |

### **PM4.0 (Particulate Matter ≤ 4.0 µm)**

| **AQI Category**     | **µg/m³**         |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Good**             | 0 - 25 µg/m³      |
| **Moderate**         | 26 - 50 µg/m³     |
| **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | 51 - 100 µg/m³  |
| **Unhealthy**        | 101 - 150 µg/m³   |
| **Very Unhealthy**   | 151 - 200 µg/m³   |
| **Hazardous**        | > 200 µg/m³       |

### **PM10.0 (Coarse Particulate Matter ≤ 10.0 µm)**

| **AQI Category**     | **µg/m³**         |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Good**             | 0 - 50 µg/m³      |
| **Moderate**         | 51 - 100 µg/m³    |
| **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | 101 - 150 µg/m³  |
| **Unhealthy**        | 151 - 250 µg/m³   |
| **Very Unhealthy**   | 251 - 350 µg/m³   |
| **Hazardous**        | > 350 µg/m³       |

These thresholds are based on air quality guidelines used by various international health agencies, and the specific levels for "moderate," "unhealthy," and other categories can vary depending on local regulations. Keep in mind that these values are subject to change as more research becomes available.

## What are the thresholds for good, moderate, poor, bad, unhealthy and hazardous for index VOC and index NOX?

For **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)** and **Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)**, the air quality categories such as **Good, Moderate, Poor, Bad, Unhealthy,** and **Hazardous** are generally not standardized in the same way as particulate matter (PM) because the assessment and categorization of air quality for these pollutants are more often done on a regional or local level, and are typically based on broader air quality indices like the **Air Quality Index (AQI)**. However, I can provide you with a general overview of what air quality thresholds might look like for **VOCs** and **NOx** in relation to air quality indexes.

### **VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) AQI Thresholds:**

VOCs, which are a group of carbon-containing chemicals, contribute to ozone formation and smog. While there isn't a widely established AQI for VOCs, they are typically measured as part of overall air quality reporting, especially with respect to their role in ozone formation.

| **AQI Category**        | **VOC Concentration (µg/m³ or ppb)** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Good**                | 0 - 50 µg/m³ or 0 - 50 ppb          |
| **Moderate**            | 51 - 100 µg/m³ or 51 - 100 ppb      |
| **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | 101 - 200 µg/m³ or 101 - 200 ppb |
| **Unhealthy**           | 201 - 300 µg/m³ or 201 - 300 ppb    |
| **Very Unhealthy**      | 301 - 500 µg/m³ or 301 - 500 ppb    |
| **Hazardous**           | > 500 µg/m³ or > 500 ppb            |

### **NOx (Nitrogen Oxides) AQI Thresholds:**

NOx includes nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and nitric oxide (NO). The concentration of NOx in the air can contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, which is harmful to human health. Like VOCs, NOx is often monitored as part of overall air quality, and specific thresholds can depend on the regulatory framework being used. Here's an example of how the AQI for NOx might be categorized:

| **AQI Category**        | **NOx Concentration (µg/m³ or ppb)** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Good**                | 0 - 50 µg/m³ or 0 - 25 ppb          |
| **Moderate**            | 51 - 100 µg/m³ or 26 - 50 ppb       |
| **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | 101 - 200 µg/m³ or 51 - 100 ppb |
| **Unhealthy**           | 201 - 400 µg/m³ or 101 - 200 ppb    |
| **Very Unhealthy**      | 401 - 800 µg/m³ or 201 - 400 ppb    |
| **Hazardous**           | > 800 µg/m³ or > 400 ppb            |

### Key Notes:
- **VOC** levels often vary depending on temperature, sunlight, and other atmospheric conditions, since they play a significant role in the formation of ozone.
- **NOx** levels can depend on traffic density, industrial activity, and weather conditions. High NOx levels are commonly associated with urban pollution, particularly in regions with high vehicular emissions.
- The thresholds provided above are more general categories. Local environmental agencies might set specific limits or AQI categories tailored to their region, which is why you might see slight variations depending on where you are.

If you're interested in a particular location's air quality data for **VOCs** or **NOx**, you can often find this information through local or national environmental monitoring agencies.

## What are the thresholds for good, moderate, poor, bad, unhealthy and hazardous for CO2 in mpp?

Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is not typically categorized into an air quality index (AQI) in the same way particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are. CO₂ is a natural component of the atmosphere and is primarily considered in the context of its contribution to **climate change** rather than short-term air quality, since it's not directly harmful to human health at the concentrations found in the atmosphere.

However, **CO₂ concentrations** can be measured in parts per million (ppm), and different concentrations of CO₂ in the air have varying implications for human health and the environment. The following is a general breakdown based on **indoor air quality** and atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, which might help provide insight into the general impact of CO₂ levels.

### **Indoor Air Quality:**

Indoor CO₂ concentrations are typically measured in **parts per million (ppm)**. Higher levels of CO₂ can cause discomfort, reduced cognitive function, and even health issues if ventilation is poor.

| **AQI Category**        | **CO₂ Concentration (ppm)** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Good**                | 350 - 500 ppm               |
| **Moderate**            | 501 - 1,000 ppm             |
| **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | 1,001 - 1,500 ppm  |
| **Unhealthy**           | 1,501 - 2,000 ppm           |
| **Very Unhealthy**      | 2,001 - 5,000 ppm           |
| **Hazardous**           | > 5,000 ppm                 |

### **Outdoor (Atmospheric) CO₂ Concentration:**

Atmospheric CO₂ levels, typically measured in **ppm**, are far lower than the indoor levels and represent the **global concentration of CO₂**. This is not something that would be categorized as "Good" or "Unhealthy" in a typical AQI sense but is more relevant in the context of **climate science**.

As of now, atmospheric CO₂ levels are generally around:

- **Pre-industrial levels**: About **280 ppm**.
- **Current levels (2024)**: Around **410 ppm** (and rising).
- **Dangerous/Climate-critical levels**: Some scientists suggest that levels above **450 ppm** could lead to significant global warming, and **500 ppm** is often viewed as a threshold for severe climate impacts.

### Key Points:

- For **indoor air quality**, CO₂ concentrations above **1,000 ppm** are typically considered poor, while concentrations above **5,000 ppm** can be hazardous.
- For **outdoor atmospheric CO₂**, it’s important to note that CO₂ is not harmful at concentrations that are currently found in the atmosphere, but it is a significant driver of **climate change** and environmental degradation.
  
So, for air quality purposes, CO₂ is generally not classified as "bad" or "hazardous" unless its concentration is very high indoors, or if discussing **climate-related thresholds** for outdoor levels.

If you're referring to a specific region or measurement type (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor), the thresholds could differ slightly, so feel free to clarify if you have a more specific focus!
